'''
This module handles the simulation loop. It implements the mainloop
of the simulation and functions to start/stop/query the status for
the GUI. Only one single simulation loop can run at a time, i.e. no
fan preview is possible while another job is running.

Terminology in this module:
* master process: process that launches workers, tracks progress and 
                  cleans up in the end. The master may or may not run
                  the GUI, and it may or may not contribute to the
                  simulation work, depending how the simulation was started.
* worker process: background processes launched with subprocess module
                  that run FreeCAD in headless mode and run simulation work.
* simulation: ray-tracing procedure that accumulates a certain amount
              of rays/hits/iterations with one or more processes. A simulation
              can be canceled or finish gracefully. Status files in the 
              simulation results folder indicate that state of a simulation.
              Only one simulation for a given FCStd file can run at a time.
